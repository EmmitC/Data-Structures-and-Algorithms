This program allows the user to swap two integers entered by them. The algorithm utilizes a temporary variable to achieve the swap. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and then displays the swapped values.
Algorithm:

    Input: The user is asked to input two numbers.
    Temporary Variable: A temporary variable temp is used to hold the value of the first number.
    Swap Process:
        The value of the first number is stored in temp.
        The second number is assigned to the first number.
        The value in temp (which is the original first number) is assigned to the second number.
    Output: The program outputs the swapped values of the two numbers.

1. Constant Time Complexity - O(1)

A constant time complexity means the algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of input size.

Example{refer to the cpp code for Constant time complexity}

Accessing an element in an array takes constant time, O(1), because it directly fetches the element without looping.


2. Linear Time Complexity - O(n)

A linear time complexity means the execution time grows proportionally with the input size.

Example{Refer to CPP code for liner time complexity}

In the worst case, we iterate through all n elements, making it O(n).


3. Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n²)[Bubble sort]

A quadratic complexity means the execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

Example{Refer to the cpp code to handle Quadratic Time Complexity}

Bubble Sort has two nested loops, making it O(n²).



4. Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)

A logarithmic complexity means the execution time increases logarithmically as input size grows.

Example {Refer to code to handle Logarithmic Time Complexity}

Each iteration reduces the search space by half, making it O(log n).
